# Admin Dashboard Tab Persistence Fix - Test Instructions

## Issue Fixed
When refreshing the page while on the "Access Codes" section (or any other section) in the admin dashboard, the page would redirect to the Overview page instead of staying on the current section.

## Solution Implemented
Added tab persistence using both localStorage and URL hash synchronization to ensure the active tab is maintained across page refreshes and browser navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Session Restoration (`app/admin/page.tsx`)
- Added logic to restore active tab from URL hash (priority) or localStorage (fallback)
- Added validation for valid tab names
- Automatic URL/localStorage synchronization

### 2. Tab Change Handler
- Created `handleTabChange()` function that:
  - Updates the active tab state
  - Persists the tab to localStorage
  - Updates the URL hash to reflect the current tab

### 3. Browser Navigation Support
- Added `hashchange` event listener to handle browser back/forward navigation
- Ensures tab state stays synchronized with URL changes

### 4. Cleanup on Logout
- Clear saved active tab when user logs out

## Test Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Tab Persistence
1. Open the admin dashboard: `http://localhost:3001/admin`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Navigate to "Access Codes" section
4. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
5. **Expected Result**: Page should stay on "Access Codes" section, not redirect to Overview

### Test 2: URL Hash Synchronization
1. Navigate to different sections in the admin dashboard
2. Notice the URL changes to include hash fragments:
   - Overview: `#overview`
   - Access Codes: `#codes`
   - Activity Logs: `#logs`
   - Analytics: `#analytics`
3. Copy a URL with a hash (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/admin#codes`)
4. Open in a new tab or share with someone
5. **Expected Result**: Should open directly to the specified section

### Test 3: Browser Navigation
1. Navigate through different sections using the sidebar
2. Use browser back/forward buttons
3. **Expected Result**: Should navigate between previously visited sections correctly

### Test 4: Persistence Across Sessions
1. Navigate to "Access Codes" section
2. Close the browser tab
3. Reopen the admin dashboard
4. Login again
5. **Expected Result**: Should open to the last visited section (Access Codes)

## Technical Details

### Valid Tab Names
- `overview` - Dashboard Overview
- `codes` - Access Codes
- `logs` - Activity Logs  
- `activity-logs` - Enhanced Activity Logs
- `analytics` - Analytics Dashboard
- `settings` - Settings (if implemented)

### Storage Keys
- `admin-active-tab` - localStorage key for persisting active tab
- URL hash format: `#<tab-name>`

### Fallback Behavior
- If invalid tab in URL/localStorage: defaults to "overview"
- If localStorage fails: continues with in-memory state
- If URL hash is invalid: uses localStorage or defaults to "overview"

## Benefits
1. **Better User Experience**: Users don't lose their place when refreshing
2. **Shareable URLs**: Can share direct links to specific admin sections
3. **Browser Navigation**: Back/forward buttons work as expected
4. **Session Persistence**: Remembers last visited section across browser sessions
5. **Robust Fallbacks**: Graceful handling of invalid states
